            <P>বাংলাদেশ,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh#/media/File:Flag_of_Bangladesh.svg">BANGLADESH</a> pronounced  officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world, with a population exceeding 163 million people in an area of either 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi) or 147,570 square kilometres (56,980 sq mi), making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast; to the south it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. It is narrowly separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the Siliguri Corridor; and from China by 100 km of the Indian state of Sikkim in the north.[16] Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's economic, political, and cultural hub. Chittagong, the largest seaport, is the second-largest city. The official language is Bengali, one of the most eastern branches of the Indo-European language family.</P>

            <p> <i id="1"> Bangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of British India in 1947.[17] The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. Ancient Bengal was an important cultural center in the Indian subcontinent as the home of the states of Vanga, Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela. The Mauryan, Gupta, Pala, Sena, Chandra and Deva dynasties were the last pre-Islamic rulers of Bengal. The Muslim conquest of Bengal began in 1204 when Bakhtiar Khalji overran northern Bengal and invaded Tibet. Becoming part of the Delhi Sultanate, three city-states emerged in the 14th century with much of eastern Bengal being ruled from Sonargaon. Sufi missionary leaders like Sultan Balkhi, Shah Jalal and Shah Makhdum Rupos helped in spreading Muslim rule. The region was unified into an independent, unitary Bengal Sultanate. Under Mughal rule, eastern Bengal continued to prosper as the melting pot of Muslims in the eastern subcontinent and attracted traders from around the world . Mughal Bengal became increasingly assertive and independent under the Nawabs of Bengal in the 18th century. <br> In 1757, the betrayal of Mir Jafar resulted in the defeat of Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah to the British East India Company and eventual British dominance across South Asia. The Bengal Presidency grew into the largest administrative unit in British India. The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. In 1940, the first Prime Minister of Bengal supported the Lahore Resolution with the hope of creating a state in eastern South Asia. Prior to the partition of Bengal, the Prime Minister of Bengal proposed a Bengali sovereign state. A referendum and the announcement of the Radcliffe Line established the present-day territorial boundary of Bangladesh.</i></p>
            
            <p> <q>  <u>  In 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan. It was renamed as East Pakistan with Dhaka becoming the country's legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952; the East Bengali legislative election, 1954; the 1958 Pakistani coup d'état; the Six point movement of 1966; and the 1970 Pakistani general election resulted in the rise of Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy movements in East Pakistan. The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to transfer power to the Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led to the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, in which the Mukti Bahini aided by India waged a successful armed revolution. The conflict saw the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and the massacre of pro-independence Bengali civilians, including intellectuals. The new state of Bangladesh became the first constitutionally secular state in South Asia in 1972.[18] Islam was declared the state religion in 1988.[19][20][21] In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed secular principles in the constitution. </u>  </q></p>
        
        <p1>Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic based on the Westminster system. Bengalis make up 98% of the total population of Bangladesh,[4] and the large Muslim population of Bangladesh makes it the third-largest Muslim-majority country. The country consists of eight divisions, 64 districts and 495 subdistricts.[23] It maintains the third-largest military in South Asia after India and Pakistan; and has been a major contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. A middle power in the Indo-Pacific,[24] Bangladesh is an emerging economy ranked as the 33rd-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and the 29th-largest by PPP. It hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world due to the Rohingya genocide.[25] Bangladesh faces many challenges, including the adverse effects of climate change,[26] poverty, illiteracy,[27] corruption, authoritarianism and human rights abuses. However, the poverty rate has halved since 2011 and the country is expected to become a middle income country in this decade.[28][29] Once a historic center of the muslin cloth trade, Bangladesh is now one of the world's largest modern garment exporters.</p1>
       
<h2>Ancient Bengal</h2> 


<p>Stone Age tools found in Bangladesh indicate human habitation for over 20,000 years,[40][page needed] and remnants of Copper Age settlements date back 4,000 years.[40] Ancient Bengal was settled by Austroasiatics, Tibeto-Burmans, Dravidians and Indo-Aryans in consecutivef waves of migration.[40][41] Archaeological evidence confirms that by the second millennium BCE, rice-cultivating communities inhabited the region. By the 11th century people lived in systemically aligned housing, buried their dead, and manufactured copper ornaments and black and red pottery.[42] The Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers were natural arteries for communication and transportation,[42] and estuaries on the Bay of Bengal permitted maritime trade. The early Iron Age saw the development of metal weaponry, coinage, agriculture and irrigation.[42] Major urban settlements formed during the late Iron Age, in the mid-first millennium BCE,[43] when the Northern Black Polished Ware culture developed.[44] In 1879, Alexander Cunningham identified Mahasthangarh as the capital of the Pundra Kingdom mentioned in the Rigveda.[45][46] The oldest inscription in Bangladesh was found in Mahasthangarh and dates from the 3rd century BCE. It is written in the Brahmi script.[47]


    The Pala Empire was an imperial power during the Late Classical period on the Indian subcontinent, which originated in the region of Bengal.
    Greek and Roman records of the ancient Gangaridai Kingdom, which (according to legend) deterred the invasion of Alexander the Great, are linked to the fort city in Wari-Bateshwar.[48][49] The site is also identified with the prosperous trading centre of Souanagoura listed on Ptolemy's world map.[50] Roman geographers noted a large seaport in southeastern Bengal, corresponding to the present-day Chittagong region.[51]</p>
<p> <strong>dark side of dhaka</strong> There are more than 200 tanneries in Hazaribagh, Dhaka, employing more than 30,000 workers.

    Every day, the tanneries discharge 21,000 cubic metres of toxic waste into gutters that flow into Dhaka's main river.
    
    In 2009, the Bangladeshi High Court asked the government to relocate the tanneries to an area outside of Dhaka.
    
    Industries Minister Dilip Barua said the government is committed to an environmentally-friendly tannery zone, but as yet, little has been done due to disagreements between the authorities and tannery owners, over who should bear the cost of moving.
    
    "This [leather] is a product that is used worldwide for luxury goods, but for these workers who are making them, neither the owners nor the government are looking after our health and safety," Abdul Malek, head of the Tannery Workers Union, told Al Jazeera.
    
    Each year 14 million raw hides are processed into leather in Bangladesh - the leather is then exported to top fashion labels in dozens of countries around the world.
    
    The country is a major supplier of leather to Europe, with Italy being the largest importer of Bangladeshi leather, buying goods this year worth around $85m.
    
    Al Jazeera’s Rob Reynolds, reported from Dhaka, "Conditions here are so bad that a new report just put out by an influential group of European and American environmental organisations, named Hazaribagh as one of the five most polluted places on the planet."
    
    And Syeda Rizwana Hasan from the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, added: "If you want to know how hell looks like ... come to the Hazaribagh tanneries and have a look at the tannery area, that should tell you perhaps how hell looks like."
    
    So, what hope is there for an improvement in the working conditions in Bangladesh’s tanneries? Is it the responsibility of the factory owners, the government or the big importers in the West?  have a more responsible role to play?
    
    Inside Story presenter Divya Gopalan, discusses with guests: Mohammed Abu Taher, chairman and managing director of the Bangladesh Finished Leather, Leather goods and Footwear Exporters Association; and Richard Pearshouse, senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, focusing on environmental issues in Asia.

    "It's hard to describe just how contaminated and polluted Hazaribagh is .... I was three times in Hazaribagh itself doing interviews with workers and local residents and each time I was in the field ... I would fall ill with some of the same symptoms that were being described by the people I was interviewing ... "

<h1>Child prostitution, garment industry, ship breaking yards</h1>

<p>Child prostitution
    Bangladesh is a corrupt country. According to Transparency International, the country is even at the bottom ranks of the world. Even though Bangladesh is an Islamic nation, it is because of this reason that brothels are flourishing. Child workers as young as 10 years old are being allowed by corrupt officials. Kidnappings, drug abuse, and human trafficking are the order of the day. I went to visit the largest brothel in Bangladesh: Daulatdia. This brothel, roughly the size of an entire town, is located at a ferry terminal. The southern part of the country, inhabited by millions of people, still isn’t connected to the capital by a bridge. So, every day, thousands of people have to take the ferry, making it Bangladesh’s busiest ferry crossing.</p>
    <p>Although I myself had already crossed the junction a couple of times, I had a hard time actually organizing a trip there. Literally everyone I asked either did not know about the place (or pretended not to know) or highly advised against going there because of security reasons. After I did a bit more research about the present NGOs in the area, I got in touch with a lady who committed herself to the children of sex workers. At the time, I was staying in Dhaka with an intelligent and well-connected guy I met earlier on a boat in Southern Bangladesh. As many people, including the lady I contacted, don’t speak English (or if they do, it is very broken English) and he was a native speaker himself, he played the role of translator between Bengali and English for me.</p>
    <p>The lady offered to meet me and showed me around. In Bangladesh, this still didn’t mean we were safe, as even NGOs can be highly corrupt and criminal. Even though it was a woman who offered to help me, that still didn’t make things more relaxed. In fact, Daulatdia is run by women and women alone. There are dozens of stories of young girls getting kidnapped on their way to school, to be sold later as sex slaves. The girls are forced to work for years to clear their “debt” – the price the “boss” has paid for them. All the dirty stuff, including the kidnapping, is almost exclusively done by women.

        After they finally pay off their debt, they often have nowhere to go, so they keep working as prostitutes. The ones who were not kidnapped are usually born in the brothels. Hundreds of children are currently growing up in the dirty and unsafe alleyways of the brothels. Most young girls don’t have a choice, other than to become sex workers themselves. They usually already start working after they have had their first period. There are close to two thousand women working in Daulatdia at the moment. The average price of buying a “fresh” (often kidnapped) girl is about $250 USD. Renting their services costs somewhere between 1 and 3 dollars, depending on their age and appearance.
        
        I got used to it after staying in the country for a while, but crowded places in Bangladesh can be perceived as highly uncomfortable and even frightening sometimes. People stare at you from all sides. People even suddenly walk up to you in groups and – due to their lack of skill in English – rudely grasp at your body, and only after a split-second of shock do you realize they only want to take a selfie with you. The visibly highly-neglected children with torn clothes and dirty faces adamantly hold onto your leg or arm and follow you for hundreds of meters. There are sick people lying on the ground with no one to take care of them. And of course, everywhere there are the unbearable smells, piles of garbage, and the sounds of people spitting on the ground.
        
        As is almost everywhere in Bangladesh, the railway tracks just outside the brothel were covered in garbage and dirt. As we walked past the tracks, I saw a surprisingly young girl, dressed in richly coloured saffron, covering her head from my camera. She, like us, entered the brothel through the same somewhat hidden entrance. A girl her age later offered to show me her room. It was a small space of about 10 square meters where she not only worked, but also lived. Most likely, she was going to spend the rest of her life in that room.</p>
